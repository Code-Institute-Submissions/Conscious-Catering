### **User Stories**

Users searching for party catering will want to see the gallery pictures and downlaodable menu/pricelist.

Business owners would like to know about supply capabilities, details of which can be found in the about page.  The contact form is available to discuss their requirements further.

Event organisers looking for a catering trailer will want to see photos, as on the landing page and in the gallery, and learn about successful past events, which can be read about on the about page.  The contact form can be used to request a callback to discuss requirements further.

Returning visitors, perhaps who have already made a booking, would like to download a menu quickly.  This can be done quickly using the menu download link in the footer.

### **Strategy**

To create an attractive online presence for this business, giving users sufficicient info in the first instance, presented in a logical and appealing way, that they enquire further and ultimately make a booking.  

### **Scope**

The site will include a landing page, an about page with factual information about cababilities, the food and past events, a photo gallery page, a menu page with buttons for opening a downloadable menus as a pdf in a new window for each of the three catering options and a contact form.  Plus a quick downloadable menu/pricelist link in the footer on all except small mobile screens.

### **Structure**

One page will flow logically to another but there will be a navigation bar which will enable navigation to any page from any other also. Plus there will be a link in the footer to quickly open a downloadable version of the full menu in a new window.

### **Skeleton**

Links to wireframes

### **Surface**

A vibrant colour scheme has been chosen inspired by the colours of fresh fruit and vegetables.
