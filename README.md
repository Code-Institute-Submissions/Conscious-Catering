# **Conscious Catering** 

Milestone One Project for Code Institute's Fullstack Software Development Diploma.

A four page website to promote a friend's Vegan Catering business, consisting of an inviting landing page, an about page giving more detailed information, a photo gallery and a contact form.  There is also the option to download a menu/pricelist as a pdf plus links to social media pages.

### **User Stories**

Users searching for party catering will want to see the gallery pictures and downlaodable menu/pricelist.

Business owners would like to know about supply capabilities, details of which can be found in the about page.  The contact form is available to discuss their requirements further.

Event organisers looking for a catering trailer will want to see photos, as on the landing page and in the gallery, and learn about successful past event, which can be read about on the about page.  The contact form can be used to request a callback to discuss requirements further.

### **Strategy**

To create an attractive online presence for this business, giving users sufficicient info in the first instance, presented in a logical and appealing way, that they enquire further and ultimately make a booking.

### **Scope**

The site will include a landing page, an about page with factual information about cababilities, the food and past events, a photo gallery page and a contact form.  Plus a downloadable menu/pricelist.

### **Structure**

One page will flow logically to another but there will be a menu bar which will enable navigation to any page from any other also. 

### **Skeleton**

Links to wireframes

### **Notes**
Struggled to make navbar items justify to the right.  Thanks Jim on Slack for helping.  Needed to use the justify-content-end class on the navbar-collapse div not on the ul that I was trying.

https://imagecolorpicker.com/ to take colors from logo. VInspired by the vibrant colours of fresh fruit and veg.

Easier to use pre-existing bootstrap class for navbar text than to make new color class.

Used Hover class to make nav items grow from external library hover.css
